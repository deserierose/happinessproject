# Overview

The disparity of happiness amongst countries has been well established by the World Happiness Report, founded in 2012. Their thorough investigation between confounding factors with happiness scores has provided valuable insight into economic and social trends around the world. 

However, the purpose of this analysis is to conduct a deeper investigation on additional indicators that may affect a countryâ€™s happiness and to provide a comprehensive view of the data from 2012 to 2022. This analysis provides an up to date summarization of happiness score trends and aims to provide targeted recommendations for policy makers, improving the quality of life within impoverished nations.
