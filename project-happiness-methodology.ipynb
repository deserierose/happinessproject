Each indicator dataset was pulled based on the data available and based on its relevance to five categories: education, government, environment, economy and health. \n\nIndicator datasets were not used in the analysis if most countries did not provide the data or if the dataset contained mostly null values. Each dataset underwent pre-processing in Excel for standardizing, addressing duplicates, trimming and dropping columns not relevant to analysis. Each dataset was then imported to PostgreSQL for analysis. \n\nSQL was used for further cleanup, general analysis (top/lowest countries, null values) and manipulation (transposing, averages, joining tables). For statistical analysis, countries were ranked by pulling the top 20 happiest countries and the top 20 unhappiest countries and assigned a country ID to be used as a primary key. \n\n\n# Statistical Analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was conducted on ranking countries. Each indicator was also assigned to one of four categories: education, government, environment, economy and health. With SQL, correlational analysis was conducted on ranking countries comparing each indicator and their happiness scores from 2012 to 2022. \n\nPython was used for a regression analysis and followed by comparing happiness and each indicator within their category. Categories with the best fit and indicators with the greatest significance were then visualized for further analysis. Using SQL, the average of the happiness scores and the average of each indicator value was queried for visualization.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}}]}
